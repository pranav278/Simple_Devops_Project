## Deploy Artifacts on a Container with Ansible

For deploying our application on a Docker container using Ansible, follow these steps:

### CI/CD with GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, and Docker

1. **Setup Ansible server:**
   - Install and configure Ansible on your server.

2. **Integrate Docker host with Ansible:**
   - Configure Ansible to manage Docker containers.

3. **Ansible playbook to create image and container:**
   - Write Ansible playbooks to build the Docker image and run it as a container.

4. **Integrate Ansible with Jenkins:**
   - Configure Jenkins to execute Ansible playbooks.

5. **Create CI/CD job on Jenkins:**
   - Set up a Jenkins job to build and deploy the application on a Docker container using Ansible.

## Deploy Artifacts on Kubernetes

To deploy our application on a Kubernetes cluster, use the following instructions:

### CI/CD with GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, and Kubernetes

1. **Setup Kubernetes (EKS):**
   - Set up a Kubernetes cluster, such as Amazon EKS.

2. **Write Pod, Service, and Deployment Manifest files:**
   - Create manifest files for Kubernetes resources.

3. **Integrate Kubernetes with Ansible:**
   - Configure Ansible to manage Kubernetes resources.
