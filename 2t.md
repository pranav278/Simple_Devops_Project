##  Step 6: Jenkins Job to Build and copy artifacts on to  dockerhost

Setting up the Docker Deployment job:

1. **Git Configuration**:
   - Add your Git repository URL to the job configuration. This is the repository where your web application's source code resides. The job will pull code from this repository for deployment.

2. **Build Triggers Configuration**:
   - Enable the job to trigger whenever a snapshot dependency is built. This ensures that the deployment process is automatically initiated whenever there are changes in the dependencies.
   - Additionally, configure the job to poll the source code management (SCM) system for changes using the cron syntax `* * * * *`. This means the job will check for changes every minute.

3. **Root POM Configuration**:
   - Specify the path to the root POM file of your Maven project. This file contains the project configuration and dependencies. The job will use this POM file to build the project.

4. **Goals and Options Configuration**:
   - Set the Maven goals and options to `clean install`. This instructs Maven to clean the project, compile the source code, run tests, package the application, and install it into the local repository.

5. **SSH Server Configuration**:
   - Specify the SSH server where Docker is hosted. This could be the IP address or hostname of your Docker host.
   - Provide the necessary authentication credentials (e.g., SSH key) to access the Docker host securely.

6. **Transfer Set Configuration**:
   - Define the files or directories to transfer to the Docker host. In this case, specify `webapp/target/*war` to transfer all WAR files generated by the Maven build process.
   - Optionally, specify any additional files or directories required for deployment.

7. **Remove Prefix Configuration**:
   - Specify the prefix to remove from the transferred files/directories. In this case, `webapp/target` is specified to remove the directory path up to the target directory.

8. **Remote Directory Configuration**:
   - Specify the directory on the Docker host where the transferred files should be placed. In this case, `/home/dockeradmin` is specified as the remote directory.

The `pwd` command in Unix-like operating systems stands for "Print Working Directory." When you enter `pwd` into the command line interface and press Enter, it displays the full, absolute path of the current working directory.

```
$ pwd

```

* Now build Job and check check webapp.jar file is created or not
